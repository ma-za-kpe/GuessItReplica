# GuessItReplica
This is a replica of the Guess it game from the Udacity kotlin course. It show cases practice of Android Architecture components from ViewModels, Livedata and so on.

# WHAT IT DOES
Guess It is a word guessing app you can play with one or more friends. To play, hold the device in landscape, facing away from you with your thumbs on the Skip and Got It buttons. Your friends can then give you clues to help you guess the word.

If you get the word right, press Got It. If you're stuck, press Skip. The game runs for a minute and then shows you your score.
